Iam a proper hyderabadi girl, born and bought up in hyderabad. i have spent my 23 years of my life in hyderabad. it's just not a place for me but an emotion. i come from a very  conservative family but have rebellious ideas towards society. iam not the person that iam with most of the people. i have a younger sister who is very confident and upfront with people. i aspire to be like her.

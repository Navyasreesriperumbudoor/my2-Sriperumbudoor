##### Favourite vacation spot : Kerala
Kerala is known as **God's own country**. it is a place filled with **greenery and back waters**. it is a place where everyone has to visit atleast once in their lifetime. my experience in kerala was very nice. it feels like we are spending some time with the nature. the local food served there is also amazing.i recommend people to try kerala's most special **puttu and idiappam** etc.
